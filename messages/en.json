            "cnc": "This is a one to one service where a nanny dedicated to your little one will attend the wedding with them. Our nanny is there to care for, play with and meet their needs as well as enabling your child to participate in attending photoshoots and facilitating special jobs such as being a ring bearer. Your nanny will blend in like a guest and allow for those special family moments whilst constantly being there to support, care and ensure your child’s safety, especially important if there happens to be a pool. Your nanny will personally liaise with you and/or your wedding planner to ensure smooth running of your special day.",
            "pnc": "This is a child-centered service, it is also a one-to-one service which often happens close by to where the wedding or event is taking place. The nanny and baby do not attend, allowing us to fully follow your children's needs and keep to routine if that is something your baby is used to. The fact that the nanny will care solely for your child means that they can be mobile, for example taking your child for naps, walks, to play, or to bed, and can bring young babies to a meeting point to facilitate breastfeeding. We discuss your child’s routine and your plans for the day ensuring they are as happy as possible and you can relax knowing we have it all in hand",
            "wcc": "This is the option we provide for groups of between 2 and 10 children. The crèche is a fun-filled day in which we set up a playspace filled with beautiful and enchanting games and activities to delight the little ones of those attending your wedding. The crèche must take place in a selfcontained room, with easy bathroom access, that is for sole use of the crèche throughout the agreed hours. A sign-in/ sign-out system allows children to be brought to and from the crèche to fit with your plan for the day, such as to be part of the wedding party or to attend a meal. The amount of children per staff member depends on their age and needs. It is a great space for children to have their needs met during a typically adult event, allowing the adults to relax and fully enjoy your special day. It is popular to have meals brought to us so children can eat with us in the crèche."
