She had sole charge of our 8 month old son for the entirety of the weekend and was brilliant with him - he took to her immediately and was enthralled by her singing, stories and games. She even brought books and toys with her! As my sister’s maid of honour, it was wonderful to be able to focus on her special time and know that our son was in good hands. Sinead was flexible, personable with guests and diligent in her duty of care.'"
