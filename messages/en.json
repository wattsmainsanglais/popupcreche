            "cnc": "This is a one to one service where a nanny dedicated to your little one will attend the wedding with them. Our nanny is there to care for, play with and meet their needs as well as enabling your child to participate in attending photoshoots and facilitating special jobs such as being a ring bearer. Your nanny will blend in like a guest and allow for those special family moments whilst constantly being there to support, care and ensure your child’s safety, especially important if there happens to be a pool. Your nanny will personally liaise with you and/or your wedding planner to ensure smooth running of your special day.",
            "pnc": "This is a child-centered service, it is also a one-to-one service which often happens close by to where the wedding or event is taking place. The nanny and baby do not attend, allowing us to fully follow your children's needs and keep to routine if that is something your baby is used to. The fact that the nanny will care solely for your child means that they can be mobile, for example taking your child for naps, walks, to play, or to bed, and can bring young babies to a meeting point to facilitate breastfeeding. We discuss your child’s routine and your plans for the day ensuring they are as happy as possible and you can relax knowing we have it all in hand",
            "wcc": "This is the option we provide for groups of between 2 and 10 children. The crèche is a fun-filled day in which we set up a playspace filled with beautiful and enchanting games and activities to delight the little ones of those attending your wedding. The crèche must take place in a selfcontained room, with easy bathroom access, that is for sole use of the crèche throughout the agreed hours. A sign-in/ sign-out system allows children to be brought to and from the crèche to fit with your plan for the day, such as to be part of the wedding party or to attend a meal. The amount of children per staff member depends on their age and needs. It is a great space for children to have their needs met during a typically adult event, allowing the adults to relax and fully enjoy your special day. It is popular to have meals brought to us so children can eat with us in the crèche."

Sinead was flexible, personable with guests and diligent in her duty of care.'"

Some parts of the day, although beautiful, can feel tiring for little ones- that’s where we come in. We arrive and create a beautiful, peaceful and fun environment for children of all ages to enjoy. Every element is thought about, from activities, toys and games, to a cosy place for story times and naps, let your guests take a breath knowing we’ve got it all covered to make their day easier. You can relax knowing that when it comes to your little guests, we have it all in hand.",
        "q2": "What can we offer?",
        "a2": "For small numbers of children our nanny service can accompany them throughout your wedding day, while you get ready and the next day to allow you a lie-in (ideal for couples getting married who also have their own little ones). For groups of children we can offer full day crèches, crèches at specific points of the day (for example during the ceremony or speeches), and crèches the day before and after (ideal for rehearsal dinners and pool parties). As the evening draws in you may want to make use of our babysitting and pyjama party services. We are happy to discuss what would best suit you and your plan for the day.",
