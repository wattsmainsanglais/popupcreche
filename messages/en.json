She had sole charge of our 8 month old son for the entirety of the weekend and was brilliant with him - he took to her immediately and was enthralled by her singing, stories and games. She even brought books and toys with her! As my sister’s maid of honour, it was wonderful to be able to focus on her special time and know that our son was in good hands. Sinead was flexible, personable with guests and diligent in her duty of care.'"

        "q1": "Why a Wedding Creche?",
        "a1": "A wedding is a special day to celebrate your love with those you love. It’s a time to let your hair down, relax and enjoy yourself after all the hard work that has gone into the planning. Some parts of the day, although beautiful, can feel tiring for little ones- that’s where we come in. We arrive and create a beautiful, peaceful and fun environment for children of all ages to enjoy. Every element is thought about, from activities, toys and games, to a cosy place for story times and naps, let your guests take a breath knowing we’ve got it all covered to make their day easier. You can relax knowing that when it comes to your little guests, we have it all in hand.",
        "q2": "What can we offer?",
        "a2": "For small numbers of children our nanny service can accompany them throughout your wedding day, while you get ready and the next day to allow you a lie-in (ideal for couples getting married who also have their own little ones). For groups of children we can offer full day crèches, crèches at specific points of the day (for example during the ceremony or speeches), and crèches the day before and after (ideal for rehearsal dinners and pool parties). As the evening draws in you may want to make use of our babysitting and pyjama party services. We are happy to discuss what would best suit you and your plan for the day.",
        "q3": "How about holidays?",
        "a3": "Whether a special holiday like a honeymoon or a much-needed family getaway you deserve to switch off while on holiday and feel as rested as possible after you return. Allow us to take the planning and organisation out of your holiday by offering engaging activities to your children while you relax. We can accompany you on every step of your trip or at specific moments to allow you time by the pool or a day out as adults. Share a romantic meal while we offer evening wind-downs, baby-sitting for little ones and pyjama parties for bigger ones.",
        "q4": "What else do I need to know",
        "a4": "We are safeguarding and first aid trained and are fully insured, and criminal record checked.
